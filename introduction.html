            <p class="text-xs leading-relaxed">
                A blockchain wallet developed on the X-World platform based on MPC multi-signature technology is more secure. Users can store cryptocurrency assets through a wallet and connect with various Web3 applications.

            <h2 class="text-md font-semibold mb-2 text-blue-600">How does X-World keep user assets safe?</h2>
            <p class="text-xs leading-relaxed">
                The wallet requires two pieces of the private key to exist at the same time in order to form a full private key and sign and approve blockchain interactions and transactions. The two pieces of private key are stored in different places, and only one of the pieces can not operate the wallet, so the security of the wallet is greatly guaranteed, and even the official staff of X-World can not operate the user's wallet.

            <h2 class="text-md font-semibold mb-2 text-blue-600">Why should your wallet back up to Google Drive?</h2>
            <p class="text-xs leading-relaxed">
                Because X-World uses MPC technology, the wallet private key is divided into two pieces, one is stored locally in the user's phone, and one is stored in the X-World server. The piece of private key stored in the user's phone is easy to lose when uninstalling the app or updating the mobile device, so backup this piece of private key to Google Drive to add a security. Note: If there is no backup wallet, and the phone is lost or the app is uninstalled, then the blockchain wallet will be completely lost.

            <h2 class="text-md font-semibold mb-2 text-blue-600">What is a recovery wallet?</h2>
            <p class="text-xs leading-relaxed">
                Blockchain wallet is actually a private key stored on the blockchain, who has the private key has the absolute control of the wallet. For security reasons, X-world does not store the user's private key, and when the user uninstalls X-world, the wallet's private key needs to read two pieces of the private key to concatenate, thus restoring the wallet.
